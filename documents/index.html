    <h1>CS 190B: JAVA-CENTRIC CLUSTER & CONCURRENT COMPUTING (HW05)</h1>
    <p>The parallel efficiency table is the following: </p>
    <img src="Graph.png" />
    <p>It runs too slow for 16 cities so I run it for 14</p>
    <p>Average parallelism is pretty big; perhaps the cutting threshold should be a little higher than now</p>
    <p>The overall efficiency is much better than the previous homework, which is a large improvement</p>
    <p>The average parallelism is pretty much the same across three experiments, which is as expected.</p>
    <p>Some improvements after HW4: Implement the space-runnable tasks in the more clever way as presented in the class. Each task has a isSpaceCallable() method which by default return (this instanceof SpaceCallable), where SpaceCallable is a marking interface. Clients can override the method if they want to make that decision at runtime or just take the default.</p>
    <p>Pruning is done before all kinds of execution, including spawning subtasks or doing actual calculation.</p>
    <p>The major design issue is how to maintain the shared object in the space and in the computers. The space should update the shared object asynchronously because updating the share should not interrupt the flow of normal execution. Moreover, the space-callable tasks should not access the shared object on the computer like other normal tasks do because there will be a RMI call for those tasks and thus slow down the whole computation</p>
    <p>To make the space update the shared object asynchronouly, a shareHandler thread is running on the space to update the shared object. Whenever a new shared object is sent to the space, the handler will notice that and check if that is better than the current one. If it is, then it will update all computer's shared objects.</p>
    <p>To solve the issue of space-runnable tasks, each task will also instantiate it's owned shared object, which is the same as the computer's ones, when the computer take that from the ready queue. When the computer send back the spawned tasks to the space, all the tasks will also have the shared object. Therefore, if a task sent back to the space is space-callable, it will have its own shared object and the space don't need to have a RMI call to the computer</p>
